# Classification of Iris Flower using Petal Length

This repository contains code and resources for performing iris flower classification using the petal length attribute. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their petal length.

## Project Overview

Iris flower classification is a classic machine learning problem where we aim to categorize iris flowers into species based on specific attributes. In this project, we focus on using the petal length attribute to classify the iris flowers.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of the three species.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Ganesh-Ganapathi/Classification-of-Iris-Flower-using-petal-length.git
cd Classification-of-Iris-Flower-using-petal-length


2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate


3. Install required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and update the file paths in the code accordingly.

2. Train and evaluate the model using the provided Jupyter notebook.

## Model

We use a simple machine learning algorithm to classify iris flowers based on the petal length attribute. The trained model is saved in the `model` directory.

## Results

The accuracy and performance metrics of the model are documented in the notebook. We also provide visualizations to illustrate the decision boundaries of the classifier.
