Project Overview
Iris flower classification is a classic machine learning problem where we aim to categorize iris flowers into species based on specific attributes. In this project, we focus on using the petal length attribute to classify the iris flowers.

Dataset
The Iris dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 iris flowers, with 50 samples from each of the three species.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-petal-length-classification.git
cd iris-petal-length-classification
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
Install required packages:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your dataset and update the file paths in the code accordingly.

Train and evaluate the model using the provided Jupyter notebook.

Model
We use a simple machine learning algorithm to classify iris flowers based on the petal length attribute. The trained model is saved in the model directory.

Results
The accuracy and performance metrics of the model are documented in the notebook. We also provide visualizations to illustrate the decision boundaries of the classifier.
